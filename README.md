# Emotional-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Adaptive-Response-System

Project Overview

The Emotional Sentiment Analysis and Adaptive Response System is a Streamlit-based chatbot prototype that identifies a user's emotional state through natural language processing (NLP) and responds with culturally sensitive, empathetic messages. The project demonstrates the integration of a pre-trained transformer model with adaptive response logic tailored to emotional and cultural contexts.

Objective

To build an intelligent chatbot capable of:

* Understanding emotional intent in user text.

* Classifying emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise.

* Responding in a culturally relevant and empathetic manner (e.g., Indian or Western style).

* Demonstrating the application of NLP for emotional wellbeing and mental health support.
